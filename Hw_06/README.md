# Help

The program is here `./the_program.py`

**My program works faster than `temp.py`**

`temp.py` - solve for python2. I was needed to know the right answer

`the_program.py.bad` - bad realiztion of `the_program.py`

`the_program.py.experiment` - experiments

`henum` - the numbers that was got from `temp.py`
`mynum` - the numbers that was got from `the_program.py.bad`
